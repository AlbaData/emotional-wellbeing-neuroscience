# 🧠 Emotional Wellbeing & Neuroscience – Data Exploration Project

Welcome to my first data analytics portfolio project!  
In this study, I explore how different lifestyle habits such as sleep, exercise, mindfulness, and personal passions relate to emotional wellbeing – through the lens of neuroscience.

This dataset is simulated, but it’s inspired by real scientific findings and public health research. The goal is to apply data science tools to uncover meaningful patterns that can help promote mental health and personal wellbeing.

## 🎯 Objective

To analyze which daily habits show the strongest correlation with emotional wellbeing, and visualize these relationships using Python and Power BI.
